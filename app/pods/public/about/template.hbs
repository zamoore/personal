      <p>
        Iâ€™m Zack, a software engineer from Orlando, Florida. I currently
        work at IZEA
        <a href="http://corp.izea.com/company/careers/" target="_blank">
          (We're looking for engineers!)
        </a>
        as a frontend developer. Here, I build and maintain our platform, train new
        engineers, and work to build a set of standards for use in our design and
        development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in software development as a craft, and seek to produce code that not only
        works, but is also elegant and easily maintainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm primarily a frontend developer, but have no issue adapting to whatever requirements
        a job may have of me. I'm always open to new work and new challenges.
        {{#link-to 'public.contact'}}Contact me{{/link-to}}, and let's get started.
